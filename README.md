# WePick!

## Project Status

WePick! was the culmination of the 15-week Software Engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School, New York City. This project was completed in three weeks during February of 2021. During those three weeks, I realized that many of my goals for the project had to be scaled back and set to "stretch" goals. Those stretch goals included encorporating the same functionality for television shows that already exists for movies. I hope to continue working on these goals to improve both functionality and styling.

## Description

WePick!'s purpose is to minimize the time spent and frustration of choosing a movie to watch with others in person, at home. Users can search for movies that they would like to watch and add those movies to their personal lists. They can then search for other users in order to compare their lists together to find matches, hopefully making movie night a simple process! Users can also receive random recommendations for a movie based on a genre selection. 

Thanks for looking and happy watching!

## Stack Info

WePick! was created with a React frontend, in combination with a Ruby on Rails API back end located in a separate repository (https://github.com/antrubbo/we_pick_backend) for deployment to Heroku (free version, be patient on startup!). It uses real-time, live movie information from The Movie Database's API (www.themoviedb.org), along with full authentication/authorization using JWT tokens and bcrypt.
