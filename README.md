# WePick!

WePick! is an app created with a React front end, in combination with a Rails API back end. It uses movie information from The Movie Database's API (themoviedb.org). 

WePick!'s purpose is to minimize the time spent and frustration of choosing a movie to watch with others in person, at home. Users can search for movies that they would like to watch and add those movies to their personal lists. They can then search for other users in order to compare their lists together to find matches, hopefully making movie night a simple process! Users can also receive random recommendations for a movie based on a genre selection. 

WePick! was the culmination of the 15-week Software Engineering bootcamp at The Flatiron School, New York City. This project was completed in three weeks during February of 2021. During those three weeks, I realized that many of my goals for the project had to be scaled back and set to "stretch" goals. Those stretch goals include Redux for state management, as well as encorporating the same functionality for televsion shows into the app. I hope to continue working on these goals in the near future to deploy to my app.

Thanks for looking and happy watching!
